  "customInstructions": "You are working on a Point of Sale (POS) system for non-profit organizations. Before starting any task:\n\n1. READ THESE FILES FIRST:\n   - .claude/rules.md - Coding standards and rules\n   - .claude/context.md - Project context and architecture\n   - .claude/prompts.md - Task-specific guidance\n\n2. ALWAYS FOLLOW:\n   - TypeScript strict mode\n   - Security-first mindset (validate inputs, prevent SQL injection)\n   - Three-tier architecture (Presentation, Application, Data)\n   - Service layer pattern for business logic\n   - RESTful API conventions\n   - Write tests for all new code (80%+ coverage)\n\n3. KEY REMINDERS:\n   - This is a LOCAL-FIRST system (self-hosted, minimal cloud)\n   - Target users: Non-profit thrift stores and donation centers\n   - Security is critical: PCI compliance for payments, audit trails\n   - Use UUID for primary keys, snake_case for database\n   - Never commit secrets, never log sensitive data\n   - Payment processing via Square SDK only (never store card data)\n\n4. REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION:\n   - docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - System overview\n   - docs/architecture/API_ENDPOINTS.md - API patterns\n   - docs/architecture/DATA_MODEL.md - Database schema\n   - docs/architecture/UI_UX_DESIGN.md - UI guidelines\n\n5. BEFORE COMMITTING:\n   - Run all tests (npm test)\n   - Check ESLint (npm run lint)\n   - Remove console.log and debugger statements\n   - Verify no secrets in code\n   - Follow conventional commit format\n\nCurrent Phase: Phase 1 - Core Functionality (see docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)\n\nRemember: Build incrementally, prioritize security, write comprehensive tests, and keep code simple and maintainable.",
